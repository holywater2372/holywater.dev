# Introduction
The Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) was first introduced by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal) in 2015, to improve the detection of malicious script before executing it. AMSI provides a runtime scanning interface that enables `AV` engines to inspect scripts, commands, and memory buffers before execution. 

It is integrated into components like UAC, Office Macros, PowerShell, and Windows Script Host (`wscript.exe` and `cscript.exe`)
