I've always been drawn to two worlds. As a kid, I fell in love with art but as I grew, I found myself in the technical realm, working with code and systems. For years, I've tried to bridge these two passions, attempting to build personal websites that captured both sides of who I am/was. I experimented with <abbr title="Jekyll">Jekyll</abbr> themes and <a href="https://holywater2372.github.io/"><span style="color: #019227;">terminal-inspired</span></a> designs, but none of them felt right. They were too rigid, too minimalist, or forced me to write raw HTML when I just wanted to create. This time, using <a href="https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite"><span style='color:#004BAD;'>a</span><span style='color:#0255AF;'>s</span><span style='color:#0460B2;'>t</span><span style='color:#066AB4;'>r</span><span style='color:#0975B7;'>o</span><span style='color:#0B7FB9;'>-</span><span style='color:#0D8ABC;'>e</span><span style='color:#1094BE;'>r</span><span style='color:#129FC1;'>u</span><span style='color:#14A9C3;'>d</span><span style='color:#17B4C6;'>i</span><span style='color:#19BEC8;'>t</span><span style='color:#1BC9CB;'>e</span></a> I'm building something different.

 Today, after completing my Master's in Cybersecurity from the <span style="color: #a599f4;">University of Warwick</span> , I work as Cybersecuirty consultant at <a href="https://csacyber.com/"><span style="color: #0aa6e6;">CSA Cyber</span></a>, specializing in offensive security with a focus on <abbr title="Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence">ML/AI</abbr> systems. My work spans Web Application and API security assessments, Network Penetration Tests, and Cloud assessments. I've also spoken at several conferences including <a href="https://youtu.be/8rAlQ0_Exf0">BSides London</a>. When I'm not working, you'll find me competing in CTFs under the online alias "<a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/1202144"><span style="color: #007adfff;">holywaterr</span></a>".


Outside work, I also enjoy playing a variety of sports including badminton, chess, tennis, and cricket. When I'm not on the court or field, you'll find me listening to music and doing amateur photography.
